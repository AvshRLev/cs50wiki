# cs50wiki
This is the second project in CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course.
It comes as a distribution code with the basic structure of the application and I added according to specifications:
Entry page, Links in the Index, the Search function, the New Page function,  the Edit Entry function, the Random page function.
I used [Python-markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) for MD to HTML conversion and [python-html2markdown](https://pypi.org/project/html2markdown/) for HTML to MD.
I hope you enjoy reading my code, 
Thank You,
Avshalom. :smiley:
